## Large Language Models (LLMs)

**Difficulty:** ★★

ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek. All these chatbots are revolutionizing our daily lives, but they all have one thing in common: **they love to collect your data.**

Any information these LLMs absorb can potentially be extracted. Let's analyze some offline and privacy-oriented solutions to enjoy AI chatbots locally.

### Prerequisites:

-   A desktop PC with a powerful CPU and plenty of RAM.
-   A GPU with as much VRAM as possible.

> No model running locally will ever match the quality and speed of the famous, well-funded services, mainly due to the limitations of your computer's power.

If you want to experiment and run some models locally, the simplest solution is **Ollama**.

1.  **Download and install Ollama.**
2.  **Download one or more models** from the internet. Look for models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters; anything larger becomes impossible to run at a sufficient speed on most home computers.
3.  **Start the model** and begin chatting.
4.  **Optional:** Install a graphical interface to make interacting with the model more comfortable. My favorite is **Open-WebUI**.

## VPS and Internet Domains

**Difficulty:** ★★

Do you need to create websites, buy domains, or host personal services on rented servers? Here are some services that I find interesting.

### Web Domains:

-   **Njalla:** For over 10 years, Njalla has been the standard for anyone who wants a privacy-oriented web domain. They require no KYC, work over Tor, and accept payments in Bitcoin.

### Server and VPS Rental:

-   **LNVps:** A provider where you can rent servers in Ireland or Canada without a traditional account (just a Nostr account). They require no KYC, no personal data, and accept Lightning payments. Server availability is low, and the service is a bit raw, but it's suitable for small self-hosting projects.
-   **VPSbg:** A server provider in Bulgaria. They accept Lightning payments, and I have personally hosted my Tor exit node with them. After years of collaboration on various projects, I have always been very satisfied from a security and privacy perspective. They are not particularly cheap.
-   **Alexhost:** This provider doesn't have particular features for anonymity, but they offer good VPS, accept Bitcoin, and have data centers in interesting jurisdictions like Switzerland.

> There are many other privacy-oriented providers that accept Bitcoin (e.g., 1984hosting, Cockbox). Look for services that fit your technical needs (bandwidth, jurisdiction, CPU). I have tried all the services mentioned above and have always been satisfied.
