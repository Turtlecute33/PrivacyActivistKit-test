## 🧠 Philosophy

> **“Privacy is a right, not a luxury.”**

The internet can be a magical place for connection, organizing, learning, and sharing — but it's also filled with data brokers, surveillance capitalism, and invasive platforms. Yuck.

This kit is rooted in the belief that privacy should be:

- 🧸 **Approachable** — You don’t need to be a hacker or techie to understand it  
- 🫶 **Inclusive** — Made for activists, artists, students, elders, teens — *everyone*  
- 🌱 **Sustainable** — Built to grow with contributions from kind humans like you  
- ❤️ **Non-corporate** — No ads, no affiliates, no sponsorship strings attached
