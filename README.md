## Why We Made This

> ‚ÄúPrivacy is a right, not a luxury.‚Äù

The internet can be a powerful space, but it‚Äôs also heavily monitored, exploited, and manipulated. That‚Äôs not okay.

This kit was created with a few core beliefs:

*   üß∏ **It should be approachable:** No tech background needed
*   ü´∂ **It should be for everyone:** Not just for coders or activists
*   üå± **It should be open:** Built to grow with the help of others
*   ‚ù§Ô∏è **It should be independent:** No ads, no sponsors, no strings attached


## What's Inside

*   Privacy Tools: A curated list of secure browsers, messaging apps, email services, search engines, VPNs, Tor tools, and file sharing platforms.
*   Guides (Coming Soon): Easy to understand, printable lessons on encryption, metadata, threat modeling, protest safety, and more.
*   Activist Resources (Coming Soon): Practical tools like security checklists, burner phone tips, VPN flowcharts, and emergency prep.
*   Shareables (Coming Soon): Posters, zines, slides, and social media visuals for easy, engaging knowledge sharing.
