## 🧠 Why We Made This

> “Privacy is a right, not a luxury.”

The internet can be a powerful space — but it’s also heavily monitored, exploited, and manipulated. That’s not okay.

This kit was created with a few core beliefs:

- 🧸 **It should be approachable** — No tech background needed  
- 🫶 **It should be for everyone** — Not just coders or activists  
- 🌱 **It should be open** — Built to grow with the help of others  
- ❤️ **It should be independent** — No ads, no sponsors, no strings
