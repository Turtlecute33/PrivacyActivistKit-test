# Threat Modeling

**Difficulty:** â˜…

Before you can protect yourself, you must understand what you're protecting yourself from. This process is called **threat modeling**. It's a structured way of thinking about the unique risks to your digital life. When it comes to privacy and security, it is crucial to be clear about **who you need to defend yourself from** and **what you need to protect**.

Your privacy needs are not the same as everyone else's. A generic approach to privacy is better than nothing, but a personalized one is far more effective.

### Who Are You Defending Against? (Threat Actors)

A "threat actor" is anyone who might want to compromise your privacy or security. Here are some common examples:

-   **Large Tech Corporations (Google, Meta, etc.):** Their business model is surveillance capitalism. They want to collect your data to build a detailed profile of you for targeted advertising.
-   **Data Brokers:** These are companies that buy and sell personal information. They get data from social media, public records, and apps you use.
-   **Governments:** Depending on where you live and what you do, you may be subject to government surveillance for intelligence gathering or law enforcement.
-   **Cybercriminals:** These actors want to steal your money, your identity, or your sensitive data for financial gain. This includes hackers who deploy ransomware or phishing attacks.
-   **A Specific, Targeted Individual:** This could be a stalker, an abusive ex-partner, a malicious co-worker, or a business rival. This is often the most dangerous threat actor, as they are personally motivated to harm you.

### How to Define Your Personal Threat Model

Ask yourself these five questions to build a clear picture of your needs:

1.  **What assets do I want to protect?**
    *   *An asset is anything of value to you. Examples: Your personal emails, your private photos, your location history, your financial information, the identity of your contacts, your browsing habits.*

2.  **Who do I want to protect it from? (Your Threat Actors)**
    *   *Refer to the list above. Be specific. Is it a global corporation or a specific person? This will change your strategy dramatically.*

3.  **How likely is it that I will need to protect it?**
    *   *Assess your risk level. Are you a high-profile journalist or activist, or are you a regular person trying to improve your general privacy hygiene?*

4.  **What are the consequences if I fail?**
    *   *What's the worst-case scenario? Annoying ads? Loss of money? Personal embarrassment? Damage to your reputation? Legal trouble? Physical danger?*

5.  **How much effort am I willing to put in?**
    *   *Be honest with yourself. Are you willing to pay for services, change your habits, or learn new, more complex software? The most secure solution is useless if you find it too inconvenient to use.*

### Example Scenarios

-   **Scenario 1: The Everyday User**
    -   **Assets:** Browsing history, shopping habits, emails.
    -   **Threat Actor:** Tech companies and advertisers.
    -   **Consequences of Failure:** Annoying targeted ads, manipulation of purchasing decisions.
    -   **Strategy:** Use a private browser, a good ad-blocker, and a privacy-focused email service. This is a low-effort, high-reward strategy.

-   **Scenario 2: The Political Activist**
    -   **Assets:** Identity, location, communications with other activists.
    -   **Threat Actor:** Government agencies, political opponents.
    -   **Consequences of Failure:** Legal trouble, physical harm, compromising the safety of others.
    -   **Strategy:** Use encrypted communication tools like Signal, anonymizing networks like Tor, and secure operating systems like Tails. This is a high-effort, critical-need strategy.

-   **Scenario 3: The Survivor of Domestic Abuse**
    -   **Assets:** Physical location, new address, personal information.
    -   **Threat Actor:** An abusive ex-partner (a stalker).
    -   **Consequences of Failure:** Physical danger, harassment.
    -   **Strategy:** The focus is less on corporate surveillance and more on operational security. This includes locking down all social media, ensuring location services are off, and being wary of phishing attempts from the abuser.

By spending a few minutes thinking through your threat model, you can focus your energy on the solutions that provide the most protection for *your* specific situation.
